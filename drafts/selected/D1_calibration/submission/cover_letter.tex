\opening{Dear Editor,}

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled \textbf{``When AI Is Confidently Wrong: Calibration and Risk Analysis of Large Language Models in Financial Decision-Making''} for consideration for publication in \textit{Finance Research Letters}.

\textbf{Summary:} This paper investigates a critical but understudied risk in financial AI: the phenomenon of \textit{overconfident errors}---cases where Large Language Models (LLMs) express high confidence but provide incorrect answers. Using CFA examination questions as a standardized benchmark for financial professional competency, we find that \textbf{29.6\% of all errors occur with confidence $\geq$ 80\%}.

\textbf{Key Contributions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First systematic evaluation of LLM calibration on professional financial certification examinations
    \item Identification and categorization of high-confidence errors across CFA topics
    \item Connection to CFA Institute Ethics Standards, arguing that overconfident AI may violate fiduciary duty requirements
    \item Policy recommendations for minimum calibration standards in financial AI systems
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Relevance to FRL:} This paper directly addresses the intersection of FinTech and AI risk management---a topic of growing importance to both practitioners and regulators. Our findings have immediate implications for the deployment of AI-assisted financial advisory services.

\textbf{Declarations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration elsewhere.
    \item All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission.
    \item We have no conflicts of interest to declare.
    \item Data and code are available at: \url{https://github.com/[repository]}
\end{itemize}

We believe this work will be of significant interest to the readership of \textit{Finance Research Letters} and look forward to your favorable consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
