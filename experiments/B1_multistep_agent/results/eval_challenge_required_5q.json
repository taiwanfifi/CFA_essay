However, it is not misleading if properly contextualized.\n   - **B: Presentation of the performance for Karibe's representative composite**: This is crucial as it must accurately reflect the performance of the composite accounts and not just Somer's past performance. If the composite performance is not clearly presented, it could mislead clients.\n   - **C: Content of the disclosure statement related to assumptions and calculations**: While important, the disclosure states that assumptions and calculations are publicly available, which is compliant. \n\n5. **Conclusion**: The most critical area for modification to ensure compliance with the CFA Standards is the presentation of the performance for Karibe's representative composite. This is essential to ensure that clients are not misled by the performance claims.\n\nFinal answer: ANSWER: B",

Your task is to analyze the scenario and select the most appropriate answer from the options A, B and C.\nScenario: TOPIC: ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS\nTOTAL POINT VALUE OF THIS QUESTION SET IS 12 POINTS \nEdgar Somer, CFA, was recently hired as a portfolio manager at Karibe Investment Management. Somer previously worked at a rival firm where he produced an average annual return of 11% using a small-cap value strategy.\nOn his first day at Karibe, the firm asks Somer to approve marketing materials that present the following performance disclosures.\n• Text which states: “Somer has generated average annual returns of 11%” \n• The 3-year performance of a composite of Karibe client accounts that follow a similar small-cap value strategy\n• A disclosure that the assumptions and calculations underlying the returns presented are publicly available on Karibe's public website\nTo maintain relationships with clients and to attract prospective clients, Somer is active on social media. He posts a link to a news story about a famous athlete who recently paid substantial tax penalties after failing to properly report investment gains. In addition to the link Somer writes the comment: “A client of mine had similar gains, but because I kept proper records he faced no penalties. #HireAProfessional”. Some responses to the post suggest that readers mistakenly believe the athlete is Somer's client. Somer does not post a clarifying comment.\nSomer develops a new quantitative investment strategy that he describes in marketing materials. The description states that “the strategy is based on eight proven fundamental and technical factors, including well-known factors such as value and momentum as well as certain proprietary factors that have been back-tested. The strategy includes a dynamic weighting component to adjust the amount allocated to each factor based on prevailing market conditions.” The materials also highlight risks such as “the possibility that the model or its underlying factors may not work out of sample,” and “because the weight placed on various factors is dynamic, it may not be suitable for clients who seek steady exposure to certain factors.” One of Somer's clients agrees to use this strategy. When preparing the first performance report for this client, Somer discovers a coding error that reversed the client's weightings assigned to the value and momentum factors.\nPrior to joining Karibe, Somer purchased shares in a small-cap technology firm for his personal portfolio. When he started his new role Somers disclosed the position, which had quadrupled in value since the initial purchase and represented more than 5\\% of his personal holdings. He had no intention to sell the shares and he recommended them to clients at Karibe, to whom he disclosed his ownership. After the successful launch of a new product resulted in additional large gains in the shares, Somer now recommends that clients place limit orders when purchasing the shares. Though he remains bullish on the stock he is concerned about the size of his personal position, which is now more than 15\\% of his portfolio. One of his clients recently placed a limit order at $50 per share, which represents the highest bid in the market. The lowest offer is $52. Somer considers filling the client's order with some of his own shares at the $50 bid price.;\nQuestion:To best comply with the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct (the Standards) related to performance presentation, Somer should modify the:;\nAnswer Choices: A: text regarding Somer's investment returns., B: presentation of the performance for Karibe's representative composite., C: content of the disclosure statement related to assumptions and calculations.. \nAnswer:"

Their spread duration may be less relevant as they are less sensitive to interest rate changes.\n\n3. **Portfolio 3: High-yield bonds with diversified call and coupon features**\n   - High-yield bonds often have more complex cash flow structures due to call features, which can lead to a greater difference between modified duration and spread duration.\n\nGiven this analysis, the portfolio most likely to have a spread duration closest to the modified duration is **Portfolio 1**, as the non-callable, fixed-rate bonds have predictable cash flows and less sensitivity to interest rate changes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: A",
