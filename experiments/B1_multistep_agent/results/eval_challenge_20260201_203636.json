Your task is to analyze the scenario and select the most appropriate answer from the options A, B and C.\nScenario: TOPIC: ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS\nTOTAL POINT VALUE OF THIS QUESTION SET IS 12 POINTS \nEdgar Somer, CFA, was recently hired as a portfolio manager at Karibe Investment Management. Somer previously worked at a rival firm where he produced an average annual return of 11% using a small-cap value strategy.\nOn his first day at Karibe, the firm asks Somer to approve marketing materials that present the following performance disclosures.\n• Text which states: “Somer has generated average annual returns of 11%” \n• The 3-year performance of a composite of Karibe client accounts that follow a similar small-cap value strategy\n• A disclosure that the assumptions and calculations underlying the returns presented are publicly available on Karibe's public website\nTo maintain relationships with clients and to attract prospective clients, Somer is active on social media. He posts a link to a news story about a famous athlete who recently paid substantial tax penalties after failing to properly report investment gains. In addition to the link Somer writes the comment: “A client of mine had similar gains, but because I kept proper records he faced no penalties. #HireAProfessional”. Some responses to the post suggest that readers mistakenly believe the athlete is Somer's client. Somer does not post a clarifying comment.\nSomer develops a new quantitative investment strategy that he describes in marketing materials. The description states that “the strategy is based on eight proven fundamental and technical factors, including well-known factors such as value and momentum as well as certain proprietary factors that have been back-tested. The strategy includes a dynamic weighting component to adjust the amount allocated to each factor based on prevailing market conditions.” The materials also highlight risks such as “the possibility that the model or its underlying factors may not work out of sample,” and “because the weight placed on various factors is dynamic, it may not be suitable for clients who seek steady exposure to certain factors.” One of Somer's clients agrees to use this strategy. When preparing the first performance report for this client, Somer discovers a coding error that reversed the client's weightings assigned to the value and momentum factors.\nPrior to joining Karibe, Somer purchased shares in a small-cap technology firm for his personal portfolio. When he started his new role Somers disclosed the position, which had quadrupled in value since the initial purchase and represented more than 5\\% of his personal holdings. He had no intention to sell the shares and he recommended them to clients at Karibe, to whom he disclosed his ownership. After the successful launch of a new product resulted in additional large gains in the shares, Somer now recommends that clients place limit orders when purchasing the shares. Though he remains bullish on the stock he is concerned about the size of his personal position, which is now more than 15\\% of his portfolio. One of his clients recently placed a limit order at $50 per share, which represents the highest bid in the market. The lowest offer is $52. Somer considers filling the client's order with some of his own shares at the $50 bid price.;\nQuestion:To best comply with the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct (the Standards) related to performance presentation, Somer should modify the:;\nAnswer Choices: A: text regarding Somer's investment returns., B: presentation of the performance for Karibe's representative composite., C: content of the disclosure statement related to assumptions and calculations.. \nAnswer:"

      "reasoning": "1. **Identify**: This question tests the CFA topic of Ethical and Professional Standards, specifically focusing on the Standards of Professional Conduct related to performance presentation and disclosure.\n\n2. **Recall**: The CFA Institute's Standards of Professional Conduct require that performance presentations be fair, accurate, and not misleading. This includes ensuring that any performance claims are substantiated and that disclosures are clear and comprehensive.\n\n3. **Extract**: The scenario provides the following key points:\n   - Somer claims to have generated average annual returns of 11%.\n   - There is a composite performance of Karibe client accounts that follow a similar strategy.\n   - There is a disclosure about the availability of assumptions and calculations on the public website.\n\n4. **Calculate**: While there are no numerical calculations required, we need to analyze the implications of the statements made:\n   - The claim of 11% average annual returns needs to be substantiated and should not mislead clients about the nature of those returns.\n   - The composite performance must accurately reflect the performance of all accounts in the composite, and it should be presented in a way that is compliant with the CFA Institute's guidelines.\n   - The disclosure about assumptions and calculations must be clear and accessible to clients.\n\n5. **Verify**: \n   - **Option A**: Modifying the text regarding Somer's investment returns may be necessary if it is misleading or not substantiated. However, if the returns are accurate and verifiable, this may not be the primary concern.\n   - **Option B**: The presentation of the performance for Karibe's representative composite must be accurate and comply with the CFA standards. If the composite performance is not presented correctly, this could mislead clients.\n   - **Option C**: The content of the disclosure statement related to assumptions and calculations must be clear and comprehensive. If it lacks clarity or is not easily accessible, it could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nGiven the context, the most pressing issue appears to be ensuring that the performance presentation for Karibe's composite is accurate and compliant with the CFA standards, as this directly impacts how clients perceive the firm's performance.\n\nFinal answer: ANSWER: B",
