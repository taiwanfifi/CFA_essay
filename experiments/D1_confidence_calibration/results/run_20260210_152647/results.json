Therefore, it may not be the primary reason for yield differences.\n\n2. **Maturity Risk Premium**: Both bonds have the same maturity (30 years), so this factor does not explain the yield difference.\n\n3. **Liquidity Risk Premium**: Treasury bonds are highly liquid and widely traded, while bonds from a small private issuer may have lower liquidity due to less market activity and fewer buyers. This lack of liquidity typically leads to a higher yield on the private issuer's bonds to compensate investors for the additional risk.\n\nGiven this analysis, the liquidity risk premium is the most relevant factor in explaining the yield difference.\n\nFinal answer: ANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 85%",
