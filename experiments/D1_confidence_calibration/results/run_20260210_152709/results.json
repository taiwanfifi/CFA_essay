Therefore, it may not be the primary reason for yield differences.\n\n2. **Maturity Risk Premium**: Both bonds have the same maturity (30 years), so this factor does not explain the yield difference.\n\n3. **Liquidity Risk Premium**: Treasury bonds are highly liquid and widely traded, while bonds from a small private issuer may have lower liquidity due to less market activity and fewer buyers. This lack of liquidity typically leads to a higher yield on the private issuer's bonds to compensate investors for the additional risk.\n\nGiven this analysis, the liquidity risk premium is the most relevant factor in explaining the yield difference.\n\nFinal answer: ANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 85%",

Let's recalculate it correctly.\n\nThe correct future value of the reinvested interest payments should be calculated for each year separately, as they are reinvested at the end of each year.\n\n1. **Year 1 Interest:**\n   \\[\n   FV = 700 \\times (1 + 0.02/12)^{12 \\times 3} \\approx 700 \\times 1.0617 \\approx €743.19\n   \\]\n\n2. **Year 2 Interest:**\n   \\[\n   FV = 700 \\times (1 + 0.02/12)^{12 \\times 2} \\approx 700 \\times 1.0408 \\approx €728.56\n   \\]\n\n3. **Year 3 Interest:**\n   \\[\n   FV = 700 \\times (1 + 0.02/12)^{12 \\times 1} \\approx 700 \\times 1.0202 \\approx €714.14\n   \\]\n\n4. **Year 4 Interest:**\n   \\[\n   FV = 700 \\times (1 + 0.02/12)^{12 \\times 0} = 700 \\approx €700\n   \\]\n\nNow, summing these values:\n\\[\nTotal\\ FV_{Interest} = 743.19 + 728.56 + 714.14 + 700 \\approx €2885.89\n\\]\n\nFinally, adding this to the future value of the CD:\n\\[\nTotal\\ FV = 22,977.64 + 2885.89 \\approx €25,863.53\n\\]\n\nThis value does not match any of the options provided. Let's check the options again.\n\nGiven the calculations and the options:\nA: €21,670\nB: €22,890\nC: €22,950\n\nThe closest value to our calculations is option C: €22,950.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 75%",

However, because the two criteria are positively related, the overlap (the stocks that pass both screens) will be less than the sum of the stocks passing each individual screen.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can estimate that the number of stocks passing both screens will be less than 50% of the total stocks, which is 50 stocks.

Therefore, the probability that the portfolio return will fail to meet the target of 4% is approximately 41%.\n\nThus, the closest answer is:\n\nANSWER: B  \nConfidence: 85%",

Current liabilities are obligations that a company expects to settle within one year or within its operating cycle, whichever is longer.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA: Payment received for a product due to be delivered at least one year after the balance sheet date - This represents a liability that is not expected to be settled within one year, so it would not be classified as a current liability.\n\nB: Payments for merchandise due at least one year after the balance sheet date but still within a normal operating cycle - Similar to option A, if the payment is due after one year, it would not be classified as a current liability.\n\nC: Payment on debt due in six months for which the company has the unconditional right to defer settlement for at least one year after the balance sheet date - Although the payment is due in six months, the right to defer settlement for more than a year means that this liability may not be classified as current.\n\nGiven this analysis, none of the options clearly fit the definition of a current liability.

This could decrease the receivables turnover ratio, not increase it.\n\nB: Due to problems with an error in its old credit scoring system, the company had accumulated a substantial amount of uncollectible accounts and wrote off a large amount of its receivables. - Writing off uncollectible accounts would reduce accounts receivable, potentially increasing the receivables turnover ratio. However, this scenario suggests a problem rather than a proactive improvement in collections.\n\nC: To match the terms offered by its closest competitor, the company adopted new payment terms now requiring net payment within 30 days rather than 15 days, which had been its previous requirement. - This change would likely lead to slower collections, as customers now have more time to pay, which would decrease the receivables turnover ratio.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B is the most plausible explanation for an increase in receivables turnover, as writing off uncollectible accounts would reduce the denominator in the turnover calculation, potentially leading to a higher ratio.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: B  \nConfidence: 85%",

This results in a future tax benefit, as the company will have to pay more tax in the later years when the accounting expense is higher than the tax expense.\n\nSince the company will have a future tax benefit due to the difference in amortization periods, it will record a deferred tax asset.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nANSWER: A  \nConfidence: 85%",

Since the revenue will not be recognized for accounting purposes until the obligation is fulfilled, there is a temporary difference between the tax treatment and the accounting treatment.\n\nIn this case, the company will have a tax liability that is recognized immediately (due to the advance payment being taxable), but it will not recognize the revenue until later.

      "raw_response": "To determine the carrying amount of the bonds on 31 December 2015 using the effective interest rate method, we need to calculate the interest expense based on the market interest rate and adjust the carrying amount accordingly.\n\n1. **Initial carrying amount**: The bonds are issued at a discount because the coupon rate (4%) is lower than the market rate (5%). The initial carrying amount is the face value of $30,000,000.\n\n2. **Interest payment**: The bonds pay 4% interest annually, which amounts to:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest Payment} = 30,000,000 \\times 0.04 = 1,200,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Interest expense**: The interest expense for the first year is calculated using the market interest rate (5%) on the carrying amount at the beginning of the year (which is the face value since it's the first year):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest Expense} = 30,000,000 \\times 0.05 = 1,500,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Amortization of the discount**: The difference between the interest expense and the cash interest payment is the amortization of the discount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Amortization} = \\text{Interest Expense} - \\text{Interest Payment} = 1,500,000 - 1,200,000 = 300,000\n   \\]\n\n5. **New carrying amount**: The carrying amount at the end of the year is the initial carrying amount plus the amortization of the discount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Carrying Amount} = 30,000,000 - 300,000 = 29,700,000\n   \\]\n\nHowever, since the bonds were issued at a discount, we need to find the actual carrying amount after the first year. The carrying amount at the end of the first year should be calculated as follows:\n\n- The carrying amount at the end of the first year is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carrying Amount} = \\text{Initial Carrying Amount} - \\text{Amortization} = 30,000,000 - 300,000 = 29,700,000\n   \\]\n\nNow, we need to check the options provided:\n\nA: $28,466,099  \nB: $28,800,000  \nC: $28,936,215  \n\nNone of these options match the calculated carrying amount of $29,700,000. However, we need to consider that the bonds were issued at a discount, and the effective interest method would lead to a carrying amount that is lower than the face value.\n\nGiven the options, the closest value to the expected carrying amount after one year of amortization would be option C: $28,936,215, as it reflects a significant discount from the face value.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 70%",

Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n- The amortization of the premium decreases each year because the effective interest expense (which is based on the carrying amount) will be lower as the carrying amount decreases.

In contrast, an operating lease is more akin to renting, where the lessee does not assume the risks and rewards of ownership, and the asset is not recorded on the balance sheet.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA: is similar to renting an asset. - This is true for an operating lease, as it is generally treated as a rental agreement.\n\nB: is equivalent to the purchase of an asset. - This is not true for an operating lease, as it does not involve ownership.\n\nC: term is for the majority of the economic life of the leased asset. - This is more characteristic of a finance lease, not an operating lease.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate answer is A.\n\nFinal answer: ANSWER: A  \nConfidence: 85%",

If both the cash flows and the initial investment double, the NPV will increase because the cash inflows are now greater than the cash outflows by a larger margin.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is that the IRR will stay the same, and the NPV will increase.\n\nThus, the appropriate choice is:\n\nANSWER: B  \nConfidence: 85%",

This is misleading because while accounts payable do not have explicit interest rates like bonds, they do represent a cost of financing in terms of the opportunity cost of not paying suppliers promptly. Therefore, the second analyst's advocacy for greater amounts of accounts payable may not be entirely correct, as it overlooks the potential costs associated with delayed payments.\n\n2. **Common Equity Financing**: The first analyst states that the interest rate on equity financing is not specified and is also implicitly zero. This is also misleading because equity financing does not have a fixed cost like debt financing (bonds). However, equity financing does come with a cost in terms of expected returns by shareholders, which can be significant. Therefore, the second analyst's suggestion to increase common equity financing is not correct either, as it ignores the cost of equity.\n\nGiven this analysis, the second analyst is not correct in his analysis of either accounts payable or equity financing.\n\nFinal answer: ANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 85%",

It is determined by the business risk of the company's operations. Since the company's operations have not changed, the asset beta will remain the same despite the increase in debt.\n\n2. **Equity Beta**: This measures the risk of the company's equity, which is affected by the company's leverage. When a company increases its debt (leverage), the equity beta increases because equity holders are taking on more risk due to the higher debt levels. This is because debt holders have a priority claim on the company's assets, which increases the risk to equity holders.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB: The asset beta will remain the same, and the equity beta will rise.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is: \nANSWER: B \nConfidence: 85%",

This increased risk usually leads to a higher required return from investors.\n\n2. **Greater Liquidity**: Greater liquidity generally reduces risk because it allows investors to buy and sell shares more easily. This would typically lead to a lower required return, not a higher one.\n\nGiven that the first issue has higher leverage, it is reasonable to conclude that the higher required return is primarily due to the increased risk associated with that leverage.

      "raw_response": "To analyze the question based on Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition II without taxes, we need to consider the implications of their theory. Proposition II states that the cost of equity increases with leverage (the use of debt) because equity holders require a higher return to compensate for the increased risk associated with higher debt levels.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA: the capital structure decision has no effect on the cost of equity. - This is incorrect according to Proposition II, as it clearly states that the cost of equity is affected by the capital structure.\n\nB: investment and the capital structure decisions are interdependent. - While there may be some interdependence in real-world scenarios, Proposition II primarily focuses on the cost of equity and does not assert this interdependence.\n\nC: the cost of equity increases as the use of debt in the capital structure increases. - This aligns perfectly with Proposition II, which indicates that as a firm increases its leverage, the risk to equity holders increases, leading to a higher cost of equity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 90%",

      "raw_response": "To analyze the question, we need to consider the implications of an increase in the WACC from 10% to 13%. \n\n1. **WACC Increase**: An increase in WACC typically indicates that the cost of financing has risen, which can happen if the company is taking on more debt or if the perceived risk of the company has increased. \n\n2. **Choice A**: \"the company’s prospects are improving.\" - This is unlikely because an increase in WACC usually suggests higher risk or cost of capital, not improved prospects.\n\n3. **Choice B**: \"equity financing is cheaper than debt financing.\" - This is also unlikely because if WACC is increasing due to a debt offering, it suggests that debt is becoming more expensive relative to equity.\n\n4. **Choice C**: \"the company’s debt/equity has moved beyond the optimal range.\" - This is the most plausible conclusion. If the WACC has increased due to a new debt offering, it may indicate that the company has taken on too much debt, moving beyond the optimal capital structure where the cost of capital is minimized.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate conclusion is that the company’s debt/equity has moved beyond the optimal range.\n\nFinal answer: ANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 85%",

This statement is generally true, as the goal of finding an optimal capital structure is to minimize the WACC, which in turn maximizes the firm's value.\n\nB: The optimal capital structure is generally close to the target capital structure. This statement is also likely true, as firms often have a target capital structure that they aim to achieve, which is typically aligned with their optimal capital structure.\n\nC: Debt can be a significant portion of the optimal capital structure because of the tax-deductibility of interest. This statement is true as well, since the tax shield provided by debt can make it an attractive component of the capital structure.\n\nGiven this analysis, all three statements are generally true, but the question asks for the one that is least likely to be true.

This does not seem to fit Takabe's approach, as he is actively trying to predict market movements to earn excess returns.\n\n- An investor generally refers to someone who allocates capital with the expectation of a future financial return. While Takabe is indeed investing in an index fund, his primary focus is on using a forecasting model to make decisions based on predictions, which suggests a more active trading strategy.\n\n- An information-motivated trader is someone who trades based on information or predictions about market movements, aiming to capitalize on perceived mispricings or trends.

In this case, while Schmidt is taking positions in both the convertible bond and the underlying stock, the primary goal is not to reduce risk but to exploit price inefficiencies.\n\n- **Arbitrage** involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between different markets or instruments. In this scenario, Schmidt is looking to profit from the inefficiencies in the pricing of convertible bonds relative to the underlying stock, which aligns with the definition of arbitrage.\n\n- **Securitization** is the process of pooling various types of debt and selling them as consolidated financial instruments. This does not apply to the scenario described.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best description of Schmidt's trading strategy is arbitrage, as he is exploiting the inefficiencies in the market for convertible bonds.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nANSWER: B  \nConfidence: 90%",

This position is considered \"long\" because he benefits if the stock price rises.\n\n2. He wrote (sold) a put option, which obligates him to buy shares of Michelin at the exercise price if the option is exercised by the buyer.

If the share price changes gradually, it suggests that the market is not fully efficient in processing this information immediately, which contradicts the definition of semi-strong efficiency.\n\n- **B: subject to behavioral biases**: If the market is subject to behavioral biases, it could lead to gradual price adjustments as investors may not react rationally or may take time to digest the information.

This feature makes them less risky compared to other types of preference shares.\n\nB: Callable preference shares - These shares can be redeemed by the issuer at a specified price after a certain date. This feature can be risky for investors because if interest rates decline, the issuer is likely to call the shares, and investors may have to reinvest at lower rates.\n\nC: Non-callable preference shares - These shares do not have the call feature, which means investors are not at risk of having their shares redeemed early. However, they do not provide the downside protection that putable shares offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, putable preference shares (A) are the least risky due to the downside protection they provide. Non-callable preference shares (C) are also relatively safe but do not offer the same level of protection as putable shares.\n\nTherefore, the least risky equity security from an investor's point of view is:\n\nANSWER: A  \nConfidence: 85%",

ROE is calculated as Net Income / Shareholders' Equity, so this option is not likely to lead to an increase in ROE.\n\nB: Net income increases at a slower rate than shareholders’ equity.\n- If net income increases at a slower rate than shareholders' equity, the ROE would actually decrease, as the numerator (net income) is growing less quickly than the denominator (shareholders' equity).\n\nC: The company issues debt to repurchase outstanding shares of equity.\n- This option involves leveraging the company by increasing debt and reducing equity.

While operating income can be used in some valuation contexts, EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is more commonly used for enterprise value multiples because it provides a clearer picture of operational performance by excluding non-cash expenses and financing costs.\n\nB: EBITDA may not be used if company earnings are negative.\n- This statement is misleading. EBITDA can still be calculated even if a company has negative net income. It is a measure of operational performance and does not depend on net income being positive.\n\nC: Book value of debt may be used instead of market value of debt.\n- This statement is also generally incorrect.

Therefore, this is not a strong weakness of present value models in general.\n\nB: Small changes in model assumptions and inputs can result in large changes in the computed intrinsic value of the security.\n- This is a well-known criticism of present value models.

      "raw_response": "To analyze the question, we need to understand how a capital-indexed bond works. \n\n1. **Coupon Rate**: The coupon rate of 6% does not change; it is fixed. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n  \n2. **Coupon Payment Calculation**: The bond has a par value of 1,000 and pays interest semi-annually. The coupon payment is calculated based on the adjusted principal amount. Since the CPI increased by 2%, the principal amount will be adjusted accordingly. \n\n   The new principal amount after the CPI adjustment will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Principal} = \\text{Original Principal} \\times (1 + \\text{CPI Increase}) = 1,000 \\times (1 + 0.02) = 1,020\n   \\]\n\n   The coupon payment is then calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Coupon Payment} = \\text{New Principal} \\times \\frac{\\text{Coupon Rate}}{2} = 1,020 \\times \\frac{0.06}{2} = 1,020 \\times 0.03 = 30.6\n   \\]\n   However, since the question asks for the coupon payment, we need to consider that the coupon payment is typically rounded to the nearest whole number, which would be 30. \n\n3. **Principal Amount**: As calculated, the principal amount increases to 1,020, which supports option C.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is that the principal amount increases to 1,020, and the coupon payment is approximately 30. \n\nThus, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 85%",

This feature generally reduces interest rate risk.\n\nB: Coupon bonds - These bonds pay a fixed interest rate, which means their prices can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates. When rates rise, the price of coupon bonds typically falls.\n\nC: Discount bonds - These bonds are sold at a price lower than their face value and do not pay periodic interest. They are also sensitive to interest rate changes, but since they do not have fixed coupon payments, their price sensitivity can vary.\n\nGiven this analysis, floaters typically have the lowest interest rate risk because their interest payments adjust with market rates, making them less sensitive to interest rate changes compared to fixed coupon bonds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: A  \nConfidence: 85%",

Generally, bond prices and market discount rates move inversely. \n\nThe question states that a bond's price is expected to increase by 5% if the market discount rate decreases by 100 basis points (bps). This indicates a certain level of price sensitivity to interest rate changes, which is often measured by duration.\n\nWhen the market discount rate increases by 100 bps, we would expect the bond price to decrease. However, due to the convexity of bonds, the price decrease is typically less than the price increase for the same change in yield.

The current six-month LIBOR is 1.00%, so the total cash flow for the first period will be 1.00% + 0.80% = 1.80%. \n\n2. **Calculate the present value of cash flows**: Since the note is priced at 97, we need to find the yield that equates the present value of the cash flows to the price of the note. The cash flows will be received every six months for two years.\n\n3. **Calculate the yield**: The yield can be calculated using the formula for the present value of cash flows.

A price of 97 suggests that the yield is higher than the coupon rate. \n\nAssuming the yield is around 2.36% (which is 1.00% + 1.36% spread), we can calculate the discount margin as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Discount Margin} = \\text{Yield} - \\text{Current LIBOR} = 2.36\\% - 1.00\\% = 1.36\\% = 136 \\text{ bps}\n\\]\nHowever, since we need to account for the spread of 80 bps, we can add that to the yield:\n\\[\n\\text{Discount Margin} = 136 + 80 = 216 \\text{ bps}\n\\]\nThis is closest to option B (236 bps).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: B  \nConfidence: 75%",

Securitization is the process of pooling various types of debt—including mortgages, car loans, or credit card debt—and selling them as consolidated securities to investors. \n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA: Reduction in disintermediation - This is not a benefit of securitization. In fact, securitization can lead to disintermediation as it allows borrowers to access capital markets directly.\n\nB: Simplification of debt obligations - While securitization can streamline the process of managing debt, it does not necessarily simplify the obligations themselves. The complexity can actually increase due to the structuring of securities.\n\nC: Creation of tradable securities with greater liquidity than the original loans - This is a key benefit of securitization. By pooling loans and converting them into securities, these instruments can be traded in the market, often providing greater liquidity than the underlying loans.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 90%",

If extension risk rises, it typically means that the SMM would increase because more loans are expected to remain outstanding longer than anticipated.\n\n- **Contraction risk** is the opposite; it occurs when interest rates fall, leading to an increase in prepayments as borrowers refinance.

This results in a capital gain.\n\n2. **Principal Payment**: At maturity, the investor will receive the principal amount (face value) of the bond. This is a guaranteed payment and is a significant part of the total return.\n\n3. **Reinvestment of Coupon Payments**: In a fixed-rate bond, the investor receives periodic coupon payments. However, since the question specifies that the investor holds the bond until maturity and does not mention reinvesting these payments, this source of return is less likely to contribute to the total return compared to the capital gain and principal payment.\n\nGiven this analysis, the source of return that is least likely to contribute to the investor's total return is the reinvestment of coupon payments.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 85%",

If an investor's investment horizon is less than the Macaulay duration, it implies that the investor will not hold the bond until its cash flows are fully realized.\n\n2. **Interest Rate Risk**: This refers to the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the market value of the bond. If interest rates rise, the market price of the bond will fall, which is known as market price risk.\n\n3. **Reinvestment Risk**: This is the risk that cash flows from the bond (interest payments) will have to be reinvested at lower rates if interest rates fall.\n\nGiven that the investor's horizon is shorter than the Macaulay duration, the investor is more exposed to market price risk because they may have to sell the bond before maturity, potentially at a loss if interest rates rise. \n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n- **A**: Incorrect. The investor is not hedged against interest rate risk; they are exposed to it.\n- **B**: Incorrect. While reinvestment risk is a concern, it is not the dominant risk in this scenario.\n- **C**: Correct.

However, this does not directly address the supply issue since a low price could incentivize more production.\n\nB: \"Competitors introduced next-generation phones at a similar price.\" - This could lead to a diversion of demand to competitors, but it does not explain why the manufacturer is still falling short in meeting demand for their own phone.\n\nC: \"Consumer incomes grew faster than the manufacturer anticipated.\" - If consumer incomes grew faster than expected, it could lead to higher demand for the phone, which would explain why the manufacturer is unable to meet the demand.\n\nGiven the context of the question, option C provides the most plausible explanation for the demand/supply imbalance, as it directly relates to an unexpected increase in demand due to rising consumer incomes.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is: ANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 85%",

If an agricultural firm increases its production and unit sales by 10%, the total revenue will increase by the amount of the price multiplied by the quantity sold. However, due to the nature of perfect competition, the price remains constant, and thus the increase in total revenue will be directly proportional to the increase in quantity sold.\n\n1. A 10% increase in total revenue is possible if the price remains constant, which is typical in perfect competition.\n2. A 10% increase in average revenue is also likely since average revenue equals price in perfect competition, and if the price remains constant, average revenue will not change.\n3.

While this is a theoretically efficient pricing strategy, it may not cover the total costs of the monopoly, especially if the monopoly has high fixed costs.\n\n2. **Long Run Average Cost (B)**: This approach considers the average cost of production over the long run, which includes both fixed and variable costs. Regulating prices based on long run average costs allows the monopoly to cover its costs and earn a normal profit, which is often the goal of regulatory bodies.\n\n3. **First Degree Price Discrimination (C)**: This involves charging each consumer the maximum they are willing to pay. While it can lead to increased profits for the monopoly, it is not a common regulatory practice as it can lead to consumer exploitation and is difficult to implement.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate choice for how a government entity would regulate prices for an authorized monopoly is based on long run average cost, as it ensures that the monopoly can cover its costs while still providing a regulated price to consumers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: B  \nConfidence: 85%",

The government deficit is influenced by government spending and tax revenues, not directly by household savings behavior.\n\n- **Option B**: A decrease in net exports and increased capital inflow could occur if domestic consumption decreases, leading to lower demand for imports. However, increased capital inflow typically suggests that foreign investors are buying domestic assets, which may not be directly related to household savings.\n\n- **Option C**: An increase in net exports and increased capital outflow suggests that the country is exporting more than it is importing, which could happen if domestic consumption falls and households save more. Increased capital outflow would imply that domestic investors are investing abroad, which could also be a reaction to lower domestic consumption.\n\nGiven the context of increased savings and unchanged output and investment, the most likely scenario is that households are saving more, leading to a decrease in consumption, which could result in an increase in net exports (as imports may decrease) and potentially increased capital outflow as investors seek opportunities abroad.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nANSWER: C  \nConfidence: 75%",
