Your task is to analyze the scenario and select the most appropriate answer from the options A, B and C.\nScenario: TOPIC: ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS\nTOTAL POINT VALUE OF THIS QUESTION SET IS 12 POINTS \nEdgar Somer, CFA, was recently hired as a portfolio manager at Karibe Investment Management. Somer previously worked at a rival firm where he produced an average annual return of 11% using a small-cap value strategy.\nOn his first day at Karibe, the firm asks Somer to approve marketing materials that present the following performance disclosures.\n• Text which states: “Somer has generated average annual returns of 11%” \n• The 3-year performance of a composite of Karibe client accounts that follow a similar small-cap value strategy\n• A disclosure that the assumptions and calculations underlying the returns presented are publicly available on Karibe's public website\nTo maintain relationships with clients and to attract prospective clients, Somer is active on social media. He posts a link to a news story about a famous athlete who recently paid substantial tax penalties after failing to properly report investment gains. In addition to the link Somer writes the comment: “A client of mine had similar gains, but because I kept proper records he faced no penalties. #HireAProfessional”. Some responses to the post suggest that readers mistakenly believe the athlete is Somer's client. Somer does not post a clarifying comment.\nSomer develops a new quantitative investment strategy that he describes in marketing materials. The description states that “the strategy is based on eight proven fundamental and technical factors, including well-known factors such as value and momentum as well as certain proprietary factors that have been back-tested. The strategy includes a dynamic weighting component to adjust the amount allocated to each factor based on prevailing market conditions.” The materials also highlight risks such as “the possibility that the model or its underlying factors may not work out of sample,” and “because the weight placed on various factors is dynamic, it may not be suitable for clients who seek steady exposure to certain factors.” One of Somer's clients agrees to use this strategy. When preparing the first performance report for this client, Somer discovers a coding error that reversed the client's weightings assigned to the value and momentum factors.\nPrior to joining Karibe, Somer purchased shares in a small-cap technology firm for his personal portfolio. When he started his new role Somers disclosed the position, which had quadrupled in value since the initial purchase and represented more than 5\\% of his personal holdings. He had no intention to sell the shares and he recommended them to clients at Karibe, to whom he disclosed his ownership. After the successful launch of a new product resulted in additional large gains in the shares, Somer now recommends that clients place limit orders when purchasing the shares. Though he remains bullish on the stock he is concerned about the size of his personal position, which is now more than 15\\% of his portfolio. One of his clients recently placed a limit order at $50 per share, which represents the highest bid in the market. The lowest offer is $52. Somer considers filling the client's order with some of his own shares at the $50 bid price.;\nQuestion:To best comply with the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct (the Standards) related to performance presentation, Somer should modify the:;\nAnswer Choices: A: text regarding Somer's investment returns., B: presentation of the performance for Karibe's representative composite., C: content of the disclosure statement related to assumptions and calculations.. \nAnswer:",

He posts a link to a news story about a famous athlete who recently paid substantial tax penalties after failing to properly report investment gains. In addition to the link Somer writes the comment: “A client of mine had similar gains, but because I kept proper records he faced no penalties. #HireAProfessional”. Some responses to the post suggest that readers mistakenly believe the athlete is Somer's client. Somer does not post a clarifying comment.\nSomer develops a new quantitative investment strategy that he describes in marketing materials. The description states that “the strategy is based on eight proven fundamental and technical factors, including well-known factors such as value and momentum as well as certain proprietary factors that have been back-tested. The strategy includes a dynamic weighting component to adjust the amount allocated to each factor based on prevailing market conditions.” The materials also highlight risks such as “the possibility that the model or its underlying factors may not work out of sample,” and “because the weight placed on various factors is dynamic, it may not be suitable for clients who seek steady exposure to certain factors.” One of Somer's clients agrees to use this strategy. When preparing the first performance report for this client, Somer discovers a coding error that reversed the client's weightings assigned to the value and momentum factors.\nPrior to joining Karibe, Somer purchased shares in a small-cap technology firm for his personal portfolio.

He had no intention to sell the shares and he recommended them to clients at Karibe, to whom he disclosed his ownership. After the successful launch of a new product resulted in additional large gains in the shares, Somer now recommends that clients place limit orders when purchasing the shares. Though he remains bullish on the stock he is concerned about the size of his personal position, which is now more than 15\\% of his portfolio. One of his clients recently placed a limit order at $50 per share, which represents the highest bid in the market. The lowest offer is $52. Somer considers filling the client's order with some of his own shares at the $50 bid price.;\nQuestion:If he fills the client's order for shares of the technology firm, would Somer violate the standard related to priority of transactions?;\nAnswer Choices: A: No, B: Yes, because the client would be disadvantaged by the trade, C: Yes, because he would benefit personally from a trade undertaken for a client. \nAnswer:",

    "query": "Carefully read the scenario provided and the subsequent question. Your task is to analyze the scenario and select the most appropriate answer from the options A, B and C.\nScenario: \n    Ruth McDougal, CFA, is a vice president of research with Cratter Finance, which covers the healthcare and medical device industry and specializes in research and valuation services.\nOne of the companies McDougal follows, Randolph Enterprises, has developed a new treatment for a brain disorder associated with memory loss. The treatment has been in late-stage clinical trials for the last year. The majority of analysts who follow Randolph Enterprises believe that the new treatment, which uses a proprietary drug, will be successful. This consensus has caused the stock price of Randolph Enterprises to trade at a historical high. McDougal agrees with the prevailing sentiment, resulting in a strong buy recommendation on the company.\nMcDougal plans to attend an industry seminar sponsored by the Institute on Aging. Randolph Industries invites her to attend as its guest with all expenses paid by Randolph. At the seminar, McDougal noted that the CEO of Turkell-Young, a public company and a major competitor of Randolph, is in attendance. While McDougal was familiar with Turkell-Young, it was not one of the firms that she actively covers.\nMcDougal was introduced to Jay Turkell, the CEO of Turkell-Young. Turkell tells her that he was aggressively seeking acquisitions and offers to pay McDougal a referral fee for any recommendations she made that resulted in an acquisition for Turkell-Young.\nAt a seminar gathering, McDougal overheard some attendees at another table mention that the results of the late-stage clinical trial for Randolph Enterprises, although not yet public, were disappointing. McDougal knew that if this news became public, Randolph Enterprises' stock price would fall, and Randolph Enterprises would then become a potential acquisition target for Turkell-Young.\nWhen McDougal returns to the office, she completes a research report on Randolph Enterprises that summarized the information she gathered at the seminar. She recommends that investors sell Randolph Enterprises shares and supports her conclusion with her opinion that too much value has been attributed to the outcome of the clinical trial for the new proprietary drug.\nMcDougal circulates the Randolph Enterprises report internally for review. Upon reading the Randolph Enterprises draft report, two portfolio managers cancel their buy orders on Randolph Enterprises on behalf of important Cratter Finance clients. Later, McDougal's report on Randolph Enterprises is released to Cratter Finance's clients.\nThe following day, it is publicly reported that Randolph Enterprises' late-stage clinical trial is not meeting expectations. McDougal's report is picked up in the press. The CEO of Turkell-Young calls McDougal and congratulates her on her work. Turkell asks if Turkell-Young could engage Cratter Finance for a special assignment to do a more in-depth analysis on Randolph Enterprises. Turkell says he is trying to assess the potential synergies Turkell-Young might have with Randolph Enterprises. Turkell executes an engagement letter with McDougal, who says she will complete the analysis in the next few weeks. Turkell-Young's engagement letter with Cratter Finance stipulates that if Turkell-Young acquires Randolph Enterprises based on McDougal's analysis, a referral fee will be paid directly to McDougal.\nMcDougal is concerned about revealing the referral fee that she could receive from Turkell-Young to her supervisor. Cratter Finance might assume that her recent buy recommendation on Turkell-Young was biased. McDougal decides to remain silent about the arrangement. McDougal justifies her actions as she does not want her colleagues to doubt her independence and objectivity.\n    ;\nQuestion:To comply with CFA Institute Standards, when invited to attend the all-expenses paid seminar as a guest of Randolph Enterprises, McDougal should:;\nAnswer Choices: A: not attend the seminar, B: accept Randolph's offer, C: decline Randolph's offer and attend the seminar as originally planned.. \nAnswer:",

    "query": "Carefully read the scenario provided and the subsequent question. Your task is to analyze the scenario and select the most appropriate answer from the options A, B and C.\nScenario: \n    Rejie Ariusu recently passed Level II of the CFA exam. His firm, Scrimm Capital, is an asset manager for several closed-end, pooled investment funds for institutional investors. Ariusu works in the real estate investment division, identifying real estate investment opportunities that are presented to Scrimm Capital's real estate investment committee for approval. Other groups within the firm include a high-yield loan group and a small-cap equity growth fund.\nScrimm Capital was founded in 2010. All three funds were established and started trading in that year. Ariusu joined the firm in 2013. Lahi Tami is the supervisor of the real estate investment group. Tami championed the adoption of the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) for the real estate group, which promotes its adherence to GIPS in its marketing materials.\nAriusu made the following statement to Tami:\nStatement 1: Scrimm Capital cannot claim compliance with GIPS standards for only certain asset classes that fall within the definition of the firm.\nTami replied:\nStatement 2: The real estate investment group claims GIPS compliance because it is a distinct business entity.\nTami requests the returns for each investment fund as of December 31, 2019, for an upcoming request for proposals from a large public pension plan.\nAriusu calculates the investment performance of the real estate group and determines that the performance results are better when calculated over the lifetime of the fund (since 2010) than when calculated since his arrival to the group in 2013. Ariusu is concerned that the performance of the real estate investment group has declined since he joined the firm, and due to this, elects to report the performance of the real estate investment group since the fund's inception.\nAt a professional networking event, Ariusu discusses the investment environment with Vert Wheeler of Pam Capital, an asset management firm in the same city as Scrimm. Ariusu describes to Wheeler the performance of the Scrimm real estate fund using investments he recommended, but not approved by the real estate investment committee. Wheeler does not know that the investment performance described by Ariusu is simulated. Wheeler is interested in Ariusu's investment ideas and invites him to share his work over dinner, where Ariusu shares the simulated investment returns for the Scrimm Capital real estate fund.\nAriusu states that the real estate portfolio can be easily replicated by Pam Capital, showing Wheeler all of the investment positions held by the real estate fund, including those Ariusu recommended, but were not approved.\nWheeler calls Tami the following day to propose a potential joint marketing opportunity, and to discuss his previous night's dinner conversation with Ariusu. Wheeler does not want to interfere with Pam Capital and asks for Tami's permission to use the investment information provided by Ariusu as a way to market the real estate investment vehicle to existing investors of Pam Capital with the potential for them to invest with Scrimm Capital. Tami tells Wheeler that Scrimm will pay a solicitation fee for each new investor Wheeler brings. Since Tami is eager to attract new investors, she agrees to share the investment performance information with Wheeler.\n    ;\nQuestion:Do the statements made by Ariusu and Tami comply with CFA Institute Standards?;\nAnswer Choices: A: Yes., B: No, Statement 1 is not compliant., C: No, Statement 2 is not compliant.. \nAnswer:",

Knight makes the following general statements about negative interest rates and their implications.\nStatement 1: To calculate the expected rate of return of Danish bonds, the observed negative short-term rates shouldn't be used as the risk-free rate.\nStatement 2: For countries facing negative short-term rates, market relationships (e.g., the yield curve) are unlikely to be distorted by other concurrent monetary policy measures.\nSwedish Bonds\nTo forecast Swedish bond return expectations, Perumal uses the Taylor rule and the data in Exhibit 1 to estimate the target nominal policy rate.\nExhibit 1\nNeutral real policy rate at trend growth and target inflation|1.2%\nTarget inflation rate|0.5%\nExpected inflation rate|1.0%\nTrend real GDP growth rate|1.0%\nExpected real GDP growth rate|2.0%\nUS Bonds\nPerumal then shifts his attention to forecasting US bond return expectations and begins estimating the risk premia for five-year US intermediate-term bonds using the data in Exhibit 2.\nExhibit 2\nOne-year nominal risk-free interest rate|2.2%\nTerm premium (five-year vs. one-year US government bond)|75 bps\nFive-year BB credit premium (over five-year US government bond)|50 bps\nEstimated liquidity premium on five-year corporate bonds|30 bps\nEmerging Market Bonds\nPerumal forecasts the expected return of emerging market bonds and identifies the unique risks of investing in these instruments.\nDirect Real Estate\nLastly, Perumal forecasts the expected returns of investing in direct real estate. He analyzes the previous ten years of multifamily residential real estate returns data. He is concerned that the volatility of the observed returns reflects smoothing.

The couple has two children, both of whom are grown and financially independent. The Johnsons plan to retire at age 65. Their investment assets total USD 5 million and are held in a combination of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts.\nCarson conducts a detailed interview with the Johnsons and developed an assessment of their risk preference and capacity for risk.

She used the following utility function to determine a preferred asset allocation for each of them.\nUm = E(Rm) - 0.005λσ^2\nCarson's assistant, Kei Osaka, compiles expected return and risk for three possible portfolios shown in Exhibit 1.

    "query": "Carefully read the scenario provided and the subsequent question. Your task is to analyze the scenario and select the most appropriate answer from the options A, B and C.\nScenario: \n    The Cherry Street Foundation is a nonprofit institution that provides resources for refugee children around the world. Over the last several years, Cherry Street has experienced a significant increase in donations, resulting in an increase to the foundation's investment portfolio of more than $100 million. Consequently, Ellie Blumenstock, Cherry Street's founder, recently concluded that the time had come to hire a professional chief investment officer (CIO) to manage this large pool of assets. Today, Blumenstock is interviewing A. J. Gelormini, a portfolio manager with over two decades of experience, for the CIO role.\n At the start of the interview, Blumenstock asks Gelormini to explain his approach to investing in global equities. Gelormini's response includes the following statements:\nStatement 1: I would utilize actively managed funds in equity market segments where the manager has confidence that the benchmark can be beaten, the liquidity of the underlying securities in the benchmark is thin, and the number of securities in the benchmark is broad. Cherry Street's tax-exempt status makes any tax burden associated with an actively managed strategy irrelevant.\nStatement 2: I would build passively managed funds internally through direct investment in individual securities. My focus would be on constructing funds that minimize tracking error versus the benchmark, subject to a constraint that each fund's volatility equals that of its relevant benchmark. Cherry Street would have several such funds, all under $5 million in assets, with benchmarks containing over 2,000 constituents.\nBlumenstock replies that Cherry Street has always used the S&P 500 as the benchmark for its entire investment portfolio and has tried to replicate its returns through direct investment in the underlying constituents. Blumenstock manages this process herself by obtaining a list of S&P 500 constituent weightings and submitting purchase and sell orders to Cherry Street's broker as necessary to appropriately reflect the weightings. Orders are typically filled immediately after the market's open. Little cash is kept on hand and trades are commission-free. Blumenstock expresses her frustration that the investment portfolio has nevertheless lagged the S&P 500 and has experienced significant tracking error.\nGelormini responds by suggesting that Cherry Street invest in a handful of factor-based strategies that track the S&P 500. He states that these strategies have the potential to improve returns while limiting tracking error versus the benchmark. He then presents Blumenstock with a one-page comparison of several such funds, a summary of which is provided in Exhibit 1. Note that the values provided in Exhibit 1 represent the average quarterly values for each of the underlying holdings in Fund A, Fund B, Fund C and each of the constituents in the S&P 500, calculated on a trailing five-year basis. All data on the underlying holdings and index constituents is sourced from their SEC filings and publicly available market data.\nExhibit 1\nFactor-Based Funds\nSummary Data (Trailing Five-Year Weighted Averages)\n|Fund A|Fund B|Fund C|S&P 500\nMarket cap ($ billions)|$72|$18|$13|$48\nP/E|24.5x|27.2x|13.8x|17.2x\nDividend yield|1.6%|1.9%|2.8%|2.1%\nTrailing 12-month EPS growth|14%|18%|3%|7%\nTrailing 12-month price return|6%|25%|12%|9%\nDebt-to-equity ratio|40%|50%|10%|35%\nBefore concluding the interview, Blumenstock mentions that she recently read several articles regarding shareholder engagement and activist investing strategies. She was particularly intrigued by the role of activists in advocating for the implementation of ESG standards at large companies. Blumenstock asks Gelormini if it would make sense for Cherry Street to participate in shareholder engagement activities or to commit to a firm that engages in activist investing, and, if so, what approach would make the most sense. Gelormini's response includes the following statements.\nStatement 3: If Cherry Street were to develop its own internally managed passive funds investing directly in individual securities, it would be difficult to participate in shareholder engagement activities without driving up costs. However, Cherry Street could, at a very low cost, engage in proxy voting for each of the individual securities it held.\nStatement 4: Plenty of activist managers focusing on ESG issues exist, and investing with one could make sense for Cherry Street. Managers of these strategies utilize the same tactics as more traditional activist investors because they both typically have shorter time horizons and take stakes in target companies greater than 10% of the target's outstanding equity. Some of these tactics include proposing significant changes in corporate governance, seeking board representation and engaging in proxy contests.\n \n    ;\nQuestion:The rationale provided by Gelormini in Statement 1 is most likely incorrect because:;\nAnswer Choices: A: the benchmark should have a limited number of underlying securities., B: the benchmark's underlying securities should have significant depth of liquidity., C: the tax burden is not a factor in considering actively managed strategies.. \nAnswer:",

However, Cherry Street could, at a very low cost, engage in proxy voting for each of the individual securities it held.\nStatement 4: Plenty of activist managers focusing on ESG issues exist, and investing with one could make sense for Cherry Street. Managers of these strategies utilize the same tactics as more traditional activist investors because they both typically have shorter time horizons and take stakes in target companies greater than 10% of the target's outstanding equity.

    "explain_query": "Scenario: \n    The Cherry Street Foundation is a nonprofit institution that provides resources for refugee children around the world. Over the last several years, Cherry Street has experienced a significant increase in donations, resulting in an increase to the foundation's investment portfolio of more than $100 million. Consequently, Ellie Blumenstock, Cherry Street's founder, recently concluded that the time had come to hire a professional chief investment officer (CIO) to manage this large pool of assets. Today, Blumenstock is interviewing A. J. Gelormini, a portfolio manager with over two decades of experience, for the CIO role.\n At the start of the interview, Blumenstock asks Gelormini to explain his approach to investing in global equities. Gelormini's response includes the following statements:\nStatement 1: I would utilize actively managed funds in equity market segments where the manager has confidence that the benchmark can be beaten, the liquidity of the underlying securities in the benchmark is thin, and the number of securities in the benchmark is broad. Cherry Street's tax-exempt status makes any tax burden associated with an actively managed strategy irrelevant.\nStatement 2: I would build passively managed funds internally through direct investment in individual securities. My focus would be on constructing funds that minimize tracking error versus the benchmark, subject to a constraint that each fund's volatility equals that of its relevant benchmark. Cherry Street would have several such funds, all under $5 million in assets, with benchmarks containing over 2,000 constituents.\nBlumenstock replies that Cherry Street has always used the S&P 500 as the benchmark for its entire investment portfolio and has tried to replicate its returns through direct investment in the underlying constituents. Blumenstock manages this process herself by obtaining a list of S&P 500 constituent weightings and submitting purchase and sell orders to Cherry Street's broker as necessary to appropriately reflect the weightings. Orders are typically filled immediately after the market's open. Little cash is kept on hand and trades are commission-free. Blumenstock expresses her frustration that the investment portfolio has nevertheless lagged the S&P 500 and has experienced significant tracking error.\nGelormini responds by suggesting that Cherry Street invest in a handful of factor-based strategies that track the S&P 500. He states that these strategies have the potential to improve returns while limiting tracking error versus the benchmark. He then presents Blumenstock with a one-page comparison of several such funds, a summary of which is provided in Exhibit 1. Note that the values provided in Exhibit 1 represent the average quarterly values for each of the underlying holdings in Fund A, Fund B, Fund C and each of the constituents in the S&P 500, calculated on a trailing five-year basis.

Your task is to analyze the scenario and select the most appropriate answer from the options A, B and C.\nScenario: \n    The Cherry Street Foundation is a nonprofit institution that provides resources for refugee children around the world. Over the last several years, Cherry Street has experienced a significant increase in donations, resulting in an increase to the foundation's investment portfolio of more than $100 million. Consequently, Ellie Blumenstock, Cherry Street's founder, recently concluded that the time had come to hire a professional chief investment officer (CIO) to manage this large pool of assets. Today, Blumenstock is interviewing A. J. Gelormini, a portfolio manager with over two decades of experience, for the CIO role.\n At the start of the interview, Blumenstock asks Gelormini to explain his approach to investing in global equities.

Cherry Street's tax-exempt status makes any tax burden associated with an actively managed strategy irrelevant.\nStatement 2: I would build passively managed funds internally through direct investment in individual securities. My focus would be on constructing funds that minimize tracking error versus the benchmark, subject to a constraint that each fund's volatility equals that of its relevant benchmark. Cherry Street would have several such funds, all under $5 million in assets, with benchmarks containing over 2,000 constituents.\nBlumenstock replies that Cherry Street has always used the S&P 500 as the benchmark for its entire investment portfolio and has tried to replicate its returns through direct investment in the underlying constituents. Blumenstock manages this process herself by obtaining a list of S&P 500 constituent weightings and submitting purchase and sell orders to Cherry Street's broker as necessary to appropriately reflect the weightings. Orders are typically filled immediately after the market's open. Little cash is kept on hand and trades are commission-free. Blumenstock expresses her frustration that the investment portfolio has nevertheless lagged the S&P 500 and has experienced significant tracking error.\nGelormini responds by suggesting that Cherry Street invest in a handful of factor-based strategies that track the S&P 500.

Your task is to analyze the scenario and select the most appropriate answer from the options A, B and C.\nScenario: \n    Joseph Dawson, CFA, is a portfolio manager for Dunsby & Hillman, an investment firm that invests in US and non-US assets. One of his clients, Mary Reid, has a well-diversified portfolio with investments in various asset classes and in different countries worldwide. The investments are in five specific countries, referred to below as countries A through E.\nReid closely follows her portfolio. She notices several economic events occurring in the markets in which she has investments. She expresses concern to Dawson about the possible effects these events may have on her portfolio.\nAs part of the annual review for his clients, Dawson meets with Linda Gonzalez, a member of the investment strategy committee in his firm. Gonzalez monitors relevant global financial events and their possible effects on the financial markets. \nDawson asks Gonzalez for insights and information regarding the countries where Reid has investments. Gonzalez provides information for those countries, which is summarized in Exhibit 1.\nFor Country A, Dawson questions whether the allocation of equities in that country should be increased in Reid's portfolio. Among other factors, Gonzalez states that Country A has an expansion rate of 0.35% per year for P/E multiples. In addition, Gonzalez has also monitored the annual long-term corporate earnings growth rate, the rate of net share repurchases for equities, and the dividend yield.\nGonzalez informs Dawson that the equities in Country B, an emerging market, have become more fully integrated with the global investment market. As a result, Gonzalez believes that Country B has a lower required rate of return. Her research also shows that Country B's overall volatility will decrease. Gonzalez has also compiled previous and new estimates of the financial aspects of Country B as shown in Exhibit 1.\nWhile further exploring options for his clients, Dawson learns of the Taylor rule and asks Gonzalez about it. Gonzalez states that the investment strategy committee compiles data that may be needed to determine the Taylor rule for a particular country, including:\n1) the real policy rate that would be targeted if growth is expected to be at trend and inflation on target,\n2) the expected and target inflation rates, and\n3) the expected and trend nominal and real GDP growth rates.\nExhibit 1: Country Information\nCountry A: Expansion rate for P/E multiples of 0.35% per year | Based on a 1 percentage point premium for corporate earnings growth over Gonzalez's expected Country A (nominal) GDP growth rate of 4.5%, the annual long-term corporate earnings growth rate is 5.5% | The rate of net share repurchases for Country A equities is 1.5% | Based on the country's main stock index, equities have a 2.75% dividend yield.\nCountry B: 2020 Estimated Data: Volatility: 17% | Correlation with global market: 0.6 | Degree of integration: 0.65 | Sharpe ratio (global and segmented markets): 0.25 | 2021 Projected Data: Volatility: 21% | Correlation with global market: 0.5 | Degree of integration: 0.55 | Sharpe ratio (global and segmented markets): 0.25\n Country C: The economy is in early expansion stage | The front section of the yield curve is increasingly sloping upward | The back half of the yield curve is a flat curve | The central bank is deemphasizing its quantitative easing program and is purchasing fewer government bonds.\nCountry D: Secularly rising current account surplus.\nCountry E: Secularly rising current account deficit.\nGonzalez's research shows that the economy of Country C (in which Reid has an equity investment) is in an early expansion stage. The front section of Country C's yield curve is increasingly sloping upward, while the back half exhibits a flat curve. Additionally, Country C's central bank is deemphasizing its quantitative easing program and is purchasing fewer government bonds.\nGonzalez has also examined the national savings and investment totals for Countries D and E. Reid understands that a country's current account balance is the difference between national saving and investment. However, she is unsure about how a current account surplus or current account deficit might impact the allocation of investments between Countries D and E. When asked by Dawson, Gonzalez stated that her research shows that Country D has a secularly rising current account surplus while Country E has a secularly rising current account deficit.\n    ;\nQuestion:Using Exhibit 1, which of the following statements is least likely to have an impact regarding reallocation of investments in Reid's portfolio?;\nAnswer Choices: A: Capital account balances are trending and sustainable., B: Markets are becoming more or less globally integrated., C: Monetary and fiscal policies are consistent with long-term stability and the phases of the business cycle.. \nAnswer:",

Gonzalez states that the investment strategy committee compiles data that may be needed to determine the Taylor rule for a particular country, including:\n1) the real policy rate that would be targeted if growth is expected to be at trend and inflation on target,\n2) the expected and target inflation rates, and\n3) the expected and trend nominal and real GDP growth rates.\nExhibit 1: Country Information\nCountry A: Expansion rate for P/E multiples of 0.35% per year | Based on a 1 percentage point premium for corporate earnings growth over Gonzalez's expected Country A (nominal) GDP growth rate of 4.5%, the annual long-term corporate earnings growth rate is 5.5% | The rate of net share repurchases for Country A equities is 1.5% | Based on the country's main stock index, equities have a 2.75% dividend yield.\nCountry B: 2020 Estimated Data: Volatility: 17% | Correlation with global market: 0.6 | Degree of integration: 0.65 | Sharpe ratio (global and segmented markets): 0.25 | 2021 Projected Data: Volatility: 21% | Correlation with global market: 0.5 | Degree of integration: 0.55 | Sharpe ratio (global and segmented markets): 0.25\n Country C: The economy is in early expansion stage | The front section of the yield curve is increasingly sloping upward | The back half of the yield curve is a flat curve | The central bank is deemphasizing its quantitative easing program and is purchasing fewer government bonds.\nCountry D: Secularly rising current account surplus.\nCountry E: Secularly rising current account deficit.\nGonzalez's research shows that the economy of Country C (in which Reid has an equity investment) is in an early expansion stage. The front section of Country C's yield curve is increasingly sloping upward, while the back half exhibits a flat curve. Additionally, Country C's central bank is deemphasizing its quantitative easing program and is purchasing fewer government bonds.\nGonzalez has also examined the national savings and investment totals for Countries D and E.

    "explain_query": "Scenario: \n    Joseph Dawson, CFA, is a portfolio manager for Dunsby & Hillman, an investment firm that invests in US and non-US assets. One of his clients, Mary Reid, has a well-diversified portfolio with investments in various asset classes and in different countries worldwide. The investments are in five specific countries, referred to below as countries A through E.\nReid closely follows her portfolio. She notices several economic events occurring in the markets in which she has investments. She expresses concern to Dawson about the possible effects these events may have on her portfolio.\nAs part of the annual review for his clients, Dawson meets with Linda Gonzalez, a member of the investment strategy committee in his firm. Gonzalez monitors relevant global financial events and their possible effects on the financial markets. \nDawson asks Gonzalez for insights and information regarding the countries where Reid has investments. Gonzalez provides information for those countries, which is summarized in Exhibit 1.\nFor Country A, Dawson questions whether the allocation of equities in that country should be increased in Reid's portfolio. Among other factors, Gonzalez states that Country A has an expansion rate of 0.35% per year for P/E multiples. In addition, Gonzalez has also monitored the annual long-term corporate earnings growth rate, the rate of net share repurchases for equities, and the dividend yield.\nGonzalez informs Dawson that the equities in Country B, an emerging market, have become more fully integrated with the global investment market. As a result, Gonzalez believes that Country B has a lower required rate of return. Her research also shows that Country B's overall volatility will decrease.

The firm has substantial staff resources in market and manager research.\nKumar is meeting with his new clients, Manuel and Kelly Garcia. The Garcias are married, both are healthy and both are 55 years old. Manuel is employed at a regional utility company as an executive overseeing renewable energy development. He plans to retire in about five years. Kelly recently retired from her teaching job to take care of their only child, Spencer, age 20, who has physical limitations from a car accident that occurred in the previous year.\nThe Garcias have both taxable and tax-advantaged investment portfolios worth a combined total of $2,500,000. They are considering adding new asset classes to their current portfolio.
