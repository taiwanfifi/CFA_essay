(For a downward­sloping yield curve, the forward rate declines asj increases.) For an upward-sloping spotcurve, the forward curve will be above the spot curve as shown in Figure 32.1. Conversely,when the spot curve is downward sloping, the forward curve will be below it.Figure 32.1 shows spot and forward curves as of July 2013. Because the spot yield curve isupward sloping, the forward curves lie above the spot curve.Figure 32.1: Spot Curve and Forward CurvesInterestRate%4.54.03.53.02.52.01.51.00.50\n......... .. ,....... ---－\n/4�--�--;'/\n· =-:_·.- - -\n--.,..... �-,,··/ -<·-\n－－-- ----\n---- ------- -:  �-.:..... - -\n,＇／\n,'/，／I�\n20'4 2016 2013 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 2032 2034 2036 2038 2040 2042－\nuly 2 017•········July 2016 — July 2015- - --·luly 2014 - - - Spul Curve\nSource: 2019 CFA® Program curriculum, Level II, Vol. 5, page 13From the forward rate model:(1 + S= (1 + S1)[1 + f(l,T - l))<T- l)\nCFA FRM CPA  cfawk1\nwhich can be expanded to:(1 + sTl = (1 + S1) [1 + f(l,l)J [1 + f( 2,l)J [1 + f( 3,l)J….

Under this strategy, an investor will purchase bonds with maturities longer thanhis investment horizon. In an upward-sloping yield curve, shorter maturity bonds have loweryields than longer maturity b onds. As the bond approaches maturity (i.e., rolls down the yieldcurve), it is valued using successively lower yields and, therefore, at successivelygherprices.If the yield curve remains unchanged over the investment horizon, riding the yield curvestrategy will produce higher returns than a simple maturity matching strategy, increasing thetotal return of a bond portfolio. The greater the difference between the forward rate and thespot rate, and the longer the maturity of the bond, the higher the total return.Consider Figure 32.2, which shows a hypothetical upward-sloping yield curve and the priceof a 3% annual-pay coupon bond (as a percentage of par).Figure 32.2: Price of a 3%, Annual Pay BondMaturity\nYield\n51015\n33.54\nPrice10095.8488.88\n9 174860．1 3．87 6\n5．545 5 ．\n053202\nA bond investor with an investment horizon of five years could purchase a bond maturing infive years and earn the 3% coupon but no capital gains (the bond can be currently purchasedat par and will be redeemed at par at maturity). However, assuming no change in the yieldcurve over the investment horizon, the investor could instead purchase a 30-year bond for$63.67, hold it for five years, and sell it for $71.81, earning an additional return beyond the3% coupon over the same period.",
