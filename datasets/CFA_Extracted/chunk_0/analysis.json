Par rates for bonds with differentmaturities make up the par rate curve or simply the par curve. By definition, the par ratewill be equal to the coupon rate on the bond. Generally, par curve refers to the par rates forgovernment or benchmark bonds.By using a process called bootstrapping, spot rates or zero-coupon rates can be derived fromthe par curve. Bootstrapping involves using the output of one step as an input to the next step.We first recognize that (for annual-pay bonds) the one-year spot rate (S1) is the same as the\none-year par rate. We can then compute S2 using S1 as one of the inputs. Continuing the\nprocess, we can compute the three-year spot rate S3 using S1 and S2 computed earlier. Let's\nclarify this with an example.\nEXAMPLE: Bootstrapping spot ratesGiven the following (annual-pay) par curve, compute the corresponding spot rate CLlfVe:Maturity123\nPar rate1.00%1.25%1.50%\nAnswer:\nS1 = 1.00% (given directly).\nTf we discount each cash flow of the bond using it. s yield, we get the market price of the bond.
